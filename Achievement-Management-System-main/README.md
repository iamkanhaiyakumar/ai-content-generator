## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### 🌓 Dark/Light Mode
Toggle between themes with one click. Preferences persist across sessions. Smooth transitions and eye-friendly color schemes.

### 🔎 Smart Student Search
Type student ID or name — results appear instantly. No more scrolling through endless lists. Auto-complete makes teacher workflows lightning-fast.

### 📊 Achievement Analytics
Visual dashboards show:
- Achievements by type (pie charts)
- Progress over time (line graphs)
- Position distribution (bar charts)
- Year-wise breakdown

### 📁 Certificate Management
- Upload formats: PDF, JPG, PNG
- Max file size: 5MB
- Secure storage with unique filenames
- One-click download access


### 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control
Routes are protected using custom Python decorators:
- `@student_required` — restricts access to authenticated students only
- `@teacher_required` — restricts access to authenticated teachers only
- `@admin_required` — restricts access to administrators only

Attempting to access a restricted route without the correct role redirects the user immediately, ensuring strict privilege separation across the application.

### 🔧 Custom Fields by Type
Each achievement category has specialized fields:

**Hackathons:** Team size, project title, tech stack, difficulty  
**Competitions:** Platform, language, problem set, ranking  
**Papers:** Journal, conference tier, impact factor, citations  
**Conferences:** Role, presentation format, audience size  
**Symposiums:** Theme, scope, participation mode

### 📤 Achievement Card Export & Sharing

Students can now generate professional achievement cards with QR codes:

- **PNG Export**: High-quality 300 DPI PNG images perfect for social media
- **PDF Export**: Printable PDF certificates ready for portfolios
- **QR Codes**: Scannable verification codes linking to public achievement pages
- **Social Sharing**: One-click sharing to LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms
- **Public Verification**: Shareable links allow anyone to verify achievements
- **Dark/Light Support**: Exported cards respect user's theme preference

**How to Use:**
1. Go to "My Achievements"
2. Click "Share Achievement" on any achievement card
3. Select "Export Card" to generate PNG/PDF
4. Download and share on LinkedIn or social media
5. Others can scan QR code to verify achievement
